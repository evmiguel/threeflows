# threeflows
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mit-teaching-systems-lab/threeflows.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mit-teaching-systems-lab/threeflows)

A barebones [Express](http://expressjs.com/) server and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) webapp for doing design sketches of flows through a challenge and pieces of the challenge experience.  Code in both environments is written in [ES6](https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es2015/).

## Server
#### Local configuration
For storing audio files, you'll need keys authorized for an S3 bucket.

#### Run locally
```
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

On Windows with MinGW, run the contents of the `dev` command on the bash command line directly.

#### Database
It's expecting [Postgres](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql) in production, and doesn't use anything locally.

Backups can be scheduled like so:

```
$ heroku pg:backups schedule DATABASE_URL --at '01:00 America/New_York'
Scheduled automatic daily backups at 01:00 America/New_York for DATABASE

$ heroku pg:backups schedules
=== Backup Schedules
DATABASE_URL: daily at 1:00 (America/New_York)
```


## UI
#### Tools
The project is built with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/) and uses Babel via [bablify](https://github.com/babel/babelify) to transpile ES6 and JSX.  It also uses [livereactload](https://github.com/milankinen/livereactload) for hot reloading of React components in local development.

For static analysis, we're experimenting with [eslint](http://eslint.org/) and [Flow](https://flowtype.org/).  The configuration for eslint uses [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/yannickcr/eslint-plugin-react) and [babel-eslint](https://github.com/babel/babel-eslint).  None of these tools trigger build failures right now, but can be run locally.

#### Watch and build with hot reloading
In another terminal, start process that will continually build the UI with hot reloading:
```
ui $ npm run watch
```
This builds artifacts and places them in the `ui/build` folder.

### Type check with Flow
This starts a [Flow](https://flowtype.org/) server in the background, and then runs a typecheck once.  There's no watch command right now.
```
ui $ npm run flow-quiet
```

### Lint and fixup with eslint
```
ui $ npm run lint-quiet
```

### Run Mocha tests
This project uses Mocha, with Chai's expect-style assertions, and Enzyme for some React testing utilities.  Tests are co-located with source code in the same folder, distinguished by a `_test.jsx` extension.  To run a process that watches and continually re-runs the tests:

```
ui $ npm run mocha-watch
```

### Run all tests
This is used in CI, and runs any and all tests in the project including linting, typechecks and actual tests.
```
ui $ npm run test
```

## Initial Heroku setup
Make sure you have [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and the [Heroku Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.heroku.com/) installed.  To run remote Postgres commands you'll also need to [install Postgres locally](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgresql).

Create the database:
```
$ heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
```

Seed the database:
```
$ heroku pg:psql
threeflows:DATABASE=> CREATE TABLE evidence (
  id serial primary key,
  app text,
  type text,
  version integer,
  timestamp timestamp,
  json jsonb
);
threeflows:DATABASE=> CREATE TABLE evaluations (
  id serial primary key,
  app text,
  type text,
  version integer,
  timestamp timestamp,
  json jsonb
);
threeflows:DATABASE=> CREATE TABLE message_popup_questions (
  id serial primary key,
  timestamp timestamp,
  questions jsonb
);

```

## Deploying to Heroku

```
$ heroku create
$ git push heroku master
$ heroku open
```
or

## Other services
[Travis](https://travis-ci.org/mit-teaching-systems-lab/threeflows) is setup for CI.  It will run on pull requests and on commits to master.

On merging to master, Travis will trigger a build.  If that build passes, Heroku will deploy the app on its own.
