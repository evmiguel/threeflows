  "I don't think of my students in terms of their race or ethnicity.  I am color blind when it comes to my teaching.",
  "The gap in the achievement among students of different races is about poverty, not race.",
  "Teachers should adapt their teaching to the distinctive cultures of African American, Latino, Asian and Native American students.",
  "In some cultures, students are embarrassed to speak in front of others so I take this into account and don't call on these students in class.",
  "When students come from homes where educational achievement is not a high priority, they often don't do their homework and their parents don't come to school events.  This lack of parental support undermines my efforts to teach these students.",
  "It is not fair to ask students who are struggling with English to take on challenging academic assignments.",
  "I believe that I should reward students who try hard, even if they are not doing well in school; building their self-esteem is important.",
  "I try to keep in mind the limits of my students' ability and give them assignments that I know they can do so that they do not become discouraged.",
  "Students of different races and ethnicities often have different learning styles and good teachers will match their instruction to these learning styles.",
  "Grouping students of different levels of achievement for instruction may benefit some students, but it can undermine the progress that could otherwise be made by higher achieving students.",
  "Before students are asked to engage in complex learning takss, they need to have a solid grasp of basic skills.",
  "With all the pressures to raise student achievement, finding and using examples for the cultural, historic and everyday lived experiences of my students takes away (or could take away) valuable time from teaching and learning what matters most.",
  "Talking about race with my colleagues could open up a can of worms; little good is likely to come from it."
